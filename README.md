Your task is to create a fully responsive blogging website that meets the following requirements:

1) Homepage: Display a minimum of 6 blogs on the homepage. Each blog should have its own title, brief description, and image (if possible).

2) Blog Details Page: When a user clicks on a blog, it should navigate to a detailed blog page with full content.

3) Animations: Use keyframe and transition animations to enhance the user experience.

4) Color Palette: Apply color theory principles when selecting your color palette to ensure the website is visually appealing and cohesive.

5) Layout: The header and footer should remain static in the layout (i.e., they must be part of a shared layout file).

6) Responsiveness: Ensure the design is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience.
